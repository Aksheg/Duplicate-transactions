# Engineering Problems

This repo contains the duplicate transactions problem you should be able to solve in a reasonable amount of time. It tests your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

## Running tests

First, you need to install the dependencies for the project by running

```sh
yarn
```

Then, you can run the tests by running

```sh
yarn test
```

While in active development, you can run the tests by running

```sh
yarn test --watch
```

## Stretch Goals

You can also choose to solve this challenge in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) by changing the file extension of the `.js` file in the `src` folder to `.ts`. i.e rename `src/duplicate-transactions.js` to `src/duplicate-transactions.ts`

Your file would be typechecked when you run the test. This project is already configured to run the tests either in js or ts.
